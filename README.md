# Attendance

**Note: This system has been replaced by [AdvantageTrack](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageTrack).**

This system was developed to automatically track student and mentor attendance at meetings. This is done by detecting when phones, laptops, and tablets are in the building based on sniffing of WiFi packets. Documentation on the system setup is available in the Wiki
